          <p>Professor Jack, I am changing the link and the sentence to something new, please enjoy: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">Enjoy!</a></p>

          <p>To visualize our first question, asking how enrollment rates by school type vary by student race & ethnicity, refer to <a href='https://www.datawrapper.de/_/mikwh/'>Chart 1</a>. We decided on combining the school types (Technical Education and Career, Program, Shelf Magnet, Public, Open, Public Charter, and College Affiliated) in each town to help focus on the ethnic and racial divide between the towns. To best visualize this data, we chose a stacked bar chart with White ethnicity in descending order. For visual purposes, Other and Hispanic/Latino are moved to the middle. Some cautions to be aware of when viewing Chart 1 are the grouping of the schools, “Other” ethnicity, and the percent of error. As stated before, the schools are combined to focus on the racial and ethnic divide between the towns, however, regional schools and other magnet schools are not included in this list due to some towns not having them or the school population being too low. American or Alaskan Native, pacific islander, and 2 or more races are classified as Other due to the limited data on the students.</p>

          <iframe title="Enrollment Rate by Student Race and Ethnicity" aria-label="Stacked Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-mikwh" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/mikwh/3/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="1411" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();

          <h2>Question 2</h2>
          <p>For <a href='https://www.datawrapper.de/_/BHua9/'>Chart 2</a>, we will be using DataWrapper compiled by NCEP. We decided to use a choropleth map to highlight the current expenditure by each town in the Hartford Area. On top of that, we also included the percentage of White and BIPOC students in each town. To summarize the totals of each town, there were five towns in which the NECP was below $17.8k. Moreover, out of those five, three of them were under $17k with $16.2k, $16.2k, and $16.4k respectively. There were 16 towns that fell in the $17.8–$19.5k category. There were seven towns that fell in the $19.5k–$21.2k category. Interestingly, there were no towns in the range of $21.2k–$22.9k, and the NCEP jumped from the $19.5k–$21.2k category to the ≥$22.9k category. Finally, there were five towns that fell in the ≥$22.9k category. What makes up the top NCEP with over $22.9k is an interesting set of towns. These five towns are Hartford, Bloomfield, East Windsor, Windsor Locks, and East Granby, all five of which have very different demographics. East Windsor and Windsor Locks have an almost even split of White and BIPOC students, whereas East Granby has almost 75% White students. Hartford and Bloomfield swing in the other direction as both have over 90% BIPOC students.</p>
